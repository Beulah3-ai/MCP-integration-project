"""
AI Outbound Voice Agent (MCP Integration Project)
------------------------------------------------
This file is a placeholder to document the structure of the project.

The actual source code (kept private) connects:
- ElevenLabs MCP Server for AI voice generation
- Twilio Voice API for outbound calls
- MCP JSON configuration for orchestration

Main Workflow:
1. Initialize MCP server connection.
2. Trigger Twilio to make an outbound call.
3. Use ElevenLabs voice synthesis to deliver tech updates to the recipient.

ðŸ“Œ NOTE: Full implementation is private. Architecture, screenshots, and setup
instructions are provided in README.md.
